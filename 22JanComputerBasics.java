A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, 
or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. 
You may already know that we can use a computer to type documents, 
send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to
 edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.

RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device 
where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in 
current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's 
processor. RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster 
to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as 
a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.

All data stored on storage media – whether that’s hard disk drives 
(HDDs), solid state drives (SSDs), external hard drives, USB flash 
drives, SD cards etc – can be converted to a string of bits, 
otherwise known as binary digits. These binary digits have a value 
of 1 or 0, and the strings can make up photos, documents, audio and video.
A byte is the most common unit of storage and is equal to 8 bits.

There are many outputs created by a computer system. These include printed 
documents, on-screen data and sound. An output device allows data to be 
transmitted by the computer in a human-friendly form, for example, sound 
being played through a speaker.

Monitor - The main output device of a computer. It forms images by converting 
		electrical energy into light in the form of tiny dots on the screen 
		called pixels. The sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels.

Printer - Used to print information on paper. Commonly uses either lasers or 
		inkjets to precisely place ink onto the page to recreate text 
		and high-quality images.

Speaker - Converts digital signals into audible sound waves.

Projector - A device that is used to project video output from the computer onto a wall or screen.

Input devices
An input device allows data such as text, images, video or sound to be entered into a computer system.

Keyboard - The most common input device used for entering text. Includes keys for word processing 
		and data inputting, and for performing specific functions.
Mouse - The most popular pointing device used to control the cursor on the screen and activated 
		when moved across a flat surface. There are usually two buttons that activate different 
		features on the screen.
Microphone - Used to convert analogue sound waves into a digital form that can be saved and 
		manipulated by the computer. A microphone can also be used to input voice commands but 
		they do not work well in noisy environments.
Scanner - Works in a similar way to a photocopier. Captures images from the source which are then 
		converted into a digital form that can be stored.
